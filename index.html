          <h2>About</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Ahmad Ibrahim Warriors Scout Group has been active since 1967.</p>
          <p>We envision each Scout to be a gentleman clean in thought,</p>
          <p>word and deed, who strives to be a student leader</p> 
          <p>and who is a cut above the rest.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>In Scouts CCA, we conduct training twice a week where Scouts</p>
          <p>experience many exciting and enriching activities and learn</p>
          <p>Scouting skills such as camping, pioneering, orienteering</p>
          <p>and outdoor cooking.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>We organise inter-unit and inter-patrol competitions like</p>
          <p>Scout Lore Quest and cooking challenge to hone our Scouting</p>
          <p>knowledge and skills. Similarly, we also participate in courses,</p>
          <p>competitions and events like the Scout Leadership Training Course,</p>
          <p>Patrol Pioneering Challenge and World Scout Day Celebration</p>
          <p>organised by the North Area of the Singapore Scout Association.</p>
